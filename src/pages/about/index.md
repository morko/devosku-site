## Hello!

I am not great at writing about myself, but I guess most of us are not. Here is my technology related "life" story.

My interest in computers started at very young age. Because my father was running an IT company I was lucky to have access to a PC. It had a 486 CPU chip and I was mainly using it to compose music with a program called Scream Tracker 3 and write small programs and games for MS-DOS.

I have studied computer science in University of Eastern Finland. The studies offered me a good basis to understand computation and algorithms. I learned the Java programming language there too, which I think is a good programming language to learn about concepts in programming.

I had always been interested about web applications and I was coding with PHP even before I went to the university. At that time JavaScript was a bit scary language for me and I tried to stay away from it. Now with Node.js and great frontend frameworks like React.js it has become my absolute favourite language.
