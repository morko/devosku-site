## Hello!

My name is Oskari Pöntinen. I have studied computer science in University of Eastern Finland. The studies gave me a good basis to understand computation and algorithms. Nowadays I focus on full-stack development with Node.js and various JavaScript based frontend frameworks.

I had always been interested about web applications and I was coding with PHP even before I went to the university. At that time JavaScript was a bit scary language for me and I tried to stay away from it. Now with Node.js and great frontend frameworks like React.js it has become my absolute favourite language.
